    <p2> <em> Being first-years at Georgia Tech, the reality of managing our own finances hit us earlier this year. With a suddenly large amount of financial independence, a rather limited knowledge of smart financial practices, and less access to cheaper options, we realized how essential it was for us to quickly gain financial knowledge and apply it to our financial habits that we constantly seek to improve. It quickly became apparent that easy-to-understand financial resources are limited, and an understanding of how to look at our spending habits through a smart financial lense sometimes is tricky (for everyone!). Inspired by the financial difficulties that many people face and the desire to help others overcome these challenges, we decided to create a finance platform called weBudget. This inclusive and supportive platform is designed to connect people based on their financial struggles, offer them advice, and give them insight into their spending. It also has resources that users can access to help them learn more about managing their finances. We hope this platform helps you on your financial journey! </em> </p2>
